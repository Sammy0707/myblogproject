<h2>
Unit 1, Outcome 1 About me, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7
</h2>

<h3>
1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.
</h3>
<p>
   - They have higher global sales, they use real time monitoring and offer instant customer support.
   <br>
1.1- The purpose to IT in modern business is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. IT, therefore, includes any mechanical or digital method by which a business office collects, maintains, retrieves or uses information. In this context, information can mean written content, documents, databases, spreadsheets, emails, audio or video files, digital forms that are completed and submitted via the internet, and much more.
</p>
<h3>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h3>
<p>
	- Learn basic steps in planning a digital project.
	- Plans and project planing tips
	- Review grant writing for digital project 
	- Understand basic management issues
	- Equipment, materials, tools, process
	- VS Code, Git & GitHub, Trello, Slack
</p>
<h2>
1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. </h2>
<p>
	- Start with what is the aim/purpose of the website
	- Name’s tiles that will be on the website
	- Main section on the website
	- Who will be checking my website
	- Hardware/software 
</p>
<h2>
1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h2>
<p>
	- Not the right equipment, planning, process
	- Halfway through a project someone releases better website with more market strategy
</p>
<h2>
1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software How do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
<p>
   - Look or review to the job you are going to do. </p>
   <P>
   - In my opinion, the first thing you should do it’s to understand the business needs.</p>
   <p>
   - Focus on the project I want to do, research what I need and what I do not need, research online which app will do my job, I may not need to spend money on any app-software.</p>
   <p>
	- Communicate, ask friends, team mate, family members for help.
</p>
<h2>
1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. </h2>
<p>
   - How has Trello helped you plan and how can Git and GitHub help with your codes version control? 
	Trello can be customised to everyone's needs. I keep my clients organised, Trello keeps me organised. It is 100% customisation, which is so important to me.
</p>
<h2>
1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2> 
<h2>
      Unit 1, Outcome </h2>
      <p>
	 - Legal constraints on online behaviour include protection of children legislation which prohibits grooming and inappropriate behaviour towards minors. You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of 	“netiquette” which describes the recommended conduct of users in various online environments. Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or offline.
      You should always ensure that you observe the correct guidelines and procedures for safe use of the Internet. It is not sufficient to know about guidelines and procedures – you must apply these when you are online. </p>
      <p>
	-  The internet has dramatically changed the way we communicate and how we handle everyday tasks.
	   We send emails, we share documents, we pay bills and we purchase goods by entering our personal details all online and without a second thought.
	   Have you ever stopped to wonder how much personal data you have shared online?
      Or what happens to that information?</p>
      <p>
	   - We’re talking about banking information, contacts, addresses, social media posts, and even your IP address and the sites that you’ve visited are all stored digitally.
	   Companies tell you that they collect this type of information so that they can serve you better, offer you more targeted and relevant communications, all to provide you with a better customer experience.
      But, is that what they really use the data for?</p>
      <p>
	   - This is the question that has been asked and answered by the EU, and why in May 2018 a new European privacy regulation called GDPR was enforced and permanently changed the way you, as a business, 
	   collect, store and use customer data.
	   In a study of more than 800 IT and business professionals that are responsible for data privacy at companies with European customers, Dell and Dimension Research found that 80% of businesses know few details or 		   nothing about GDPR.
	   Recently, TrustArc found that only 20% of businesses believe they are now GDPR complaint.

<h2>
Unit 1, Outcome 2 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5  Now you’ve set up your website, it’s time to critically review it. At the bottom of the website add a review section that covers the following points:</h2>

<p>
- Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </p>
<p>
- Yes I am glad to have a chance to use Visual Studio Code, I learnt some basic steps as I never used VSC or tried to coding before.</p>
<p>
- I never used Trello before but it seems good tool to use it does help you to plan ahead, more organised and focussed on the work you are doing.</p>
<p>
- CodePen is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers. </p>
<p>
- Build and deploy a website, show off your work, build test cases to learn and debug, and find inspiration, unfortunately I did not have a chance to use it.</p>
<h2>
2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate e.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h2>
<p>
- I believe the selected IT tools were appropriate.</p>
<p>
- Visual Studio Code was appropriate/inappropriate because…</p>
<p>
- Trello was appropriate/inappropriate because…</p>
<h2>
2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project. Are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h2>
<p>
- Yeah I would say I am happy with the work I have done and be able to create my 1st website, it does not look     professional but looks okay.</p>
<p>
- I just need to practice more to get better and improve my self.</p>
<p>
- Luck of experience, not revising at home because I have a very slow computer.</p>
<h2>
2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2>
<p>
- Revise & organise my self, learn more stuff.</p>
<p>
- Revisit resource forecasts weekly. Everything I stated about project financials goes for the resource forecast as well. </p>
<p>
- Plus, your project resources are usually the most expensive part of the project so they play into the project financials anyway. Working on one and not the other is certainly not wise.</p>
<p>
- By streamlining your business process you’ll have less errors and delays, and customer satisfaction will improve. </p>
<p>
- Sounds great right? Well, here are some steps you can take to cut waste, boost efficiency and improve  your business process.</p>

<h2>

2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose Check the assignment brief for all the ‘doing’ points </h2>
<p>
2.1 Preparing appropriate content for your site - I have researched and written all content in a word editor and will put these into HTML later.</p>
<p>
2.2 Organise and combine information needed for webpages including different platforms </p>
<p>
- I have used Trello to combine information needed for webpages.</p>
<p>
2.3 Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation - I have used Google.</p>
<p>
2.4 Select and use appropriate development techniques to link information across pages</p>
<p>
- Check that a link is the first focusable control on the Web page.</p>
<p>
- Check that the description of the link communicates that it links to the main content.</p>
<p>
- Check that the link is either always visible or visible when it has keyboard focus.</p>
<p>
- Check that activating the link moves the focus to the main content.</p>
<p>
- Check that after activating the link, the keyboard focus has moved to the main content.</p>
<p>
2.5 Changing file formats for documents if necessary to display on your site - I have used text edit.</p>
<p>
2.6 Error free pages that are fit for purpose - I used dictionery and Google for error free. </p>

<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 </h2>
<h2>
3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
<p>
- I think it won’t be any differences, I believe I could do better if I my project in teamwork. </p>
   <p>
- Teamwork combines the individual efforts of all team members to achieve a goal,</p>
   <p>
- people working collaboratively complete a project collectively.</p>
   <p>
- By eliminating the elements are not pulling it, make it more attractive by adding more buttons/options for users.</p>
<h2>
3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
<p>
- Minimise interruptions to the best of your ability.</p>
   <p>
- Interruptions may mean setting office hours, keeping your door closed, or working from home for time-sensitive projects.</p>
   <p>
- Take regular breaks.</p>
   <p>
- Performance; while working at a task without breaks leads to a steady decline in performance.</p>
<h2>
3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
<p>
- I will do my best and try to do better next time, I will use Trello  and Slack maybe to help me make my plans, work in a teamwork, communicate.</p>
   <p>
- I believe using Slack will help me communicate with my teamwork sharing files and ideas and make the job easier to rich the our goal.</p>
<h2>
3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2>
<p>
- Test integration of services across local platforms, private and public clouds</p>
<p>
- Testing of end-to-end workflows, and the orchestration of data and services</p>
<p>
- Consistency of solutions across multiple channel interfaces (mobile, social and traditional systems).</p>
<p>
- (front desk support system, customer accessible web portals, and customer accessible mobile apps). </p>
<p>
- This is especially in light of rapidly increasing machine configurations and browser versions. So the major digital implementation challenge is directly related to the validation of customer experience.</p>
<h2>
Unit 2, Outcome 1 1.1, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 </h2>
<h3>

1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
	<p>
      All the content in the blog is laid out from Unit 1 to Unit 2 in an easy to read way. All the questions are arranged in numerical order. Each section is divided by subheadings and each question is also a subheading. I have put any references in at the end of the paragraph. I have chosen a background colour and I have changed the font style.
</p>
<h3>
1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
<p>
- Copyright means that if you create a video or image no-one has the right to use them, the only person who has the copy right to use is you. You can use someone else’s image or video for educational or News and that’s called faire use.</p>
<p>
- Copyright is a set of laws giving the creator of an original work the exclusive right to copy, alter, distribute, or perform/display the work for a certain amount of time, or authorize others to do so.</p>
<p>
- If you are a content creator (writer, composer, sculptor, photographer, etc), copyright allows you to make money from your hard work.</p>
<p>
- If you are a content user (just about everybody else), copyright limits what you can do with others' work without their permission.</p>
<p>
- When you're creating something, copyright prevents you from using others' materials without permission or an exception in the law. </p>
   <p>
- When you've created something, copyright prevents others from using it without your permission or an exception in the law.</p>
<p>
- Ideas in themselves cannot be copyrighted in the United States, according to the Copyright Act. </p>
<p>
- Writings that describe or discuss a business idea may receive copyright protection, but such a copyright would not prevent others from putting the ideas into practice. </p>
<p>
- Visit copyright.gov for more information. </p>
<p>
- My opinion is to use your own videos, photographs… because you are sure that they are yours.</p>
<h3>
1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h3 >
	<p>
- This section describes several general groupings of disabilities, and how they affect access to the Web. There are no universally accepted or absolute categorisations of disability. Disability terminology varies from country to country, and between different disability communities in the same country. Abilities can vary from person to person, or over time, for different people with the same kind of disability. People can have combinations of different limitations, such as a visual and hearing disability together. This particular combination of disabilities is described below.</p>
<p>
- The term "disability" itself is also used very generally in this document. Many people with conditions described below would not consider themselves to have disabilities; they may, however, have limitations related to sensory, physical or cognitive functioning which can affect access to the Web. Limitations can include injury-related and aging-related conditions, and can be temporary ,or chronic. An example of an injury-related limitation that is temporary for some people and chronic for others repetitive stress syndrome. There is a trend in some communities away from using medical terminology to describe disability, and a trend in many communities away from using negative terminology or epithets frequently used in the past. This Draft Note does not attempt to comprehensively address these issues of terminology.</p>
<p>
- Different disabilities sometimes require similar accommodations. For instance, both someone who is blind and someone who cannot use his or her hands require full keyboard support for the commands in browsers and authoring tools, since they both have difficulty using a mouse but can use different assistive technologies to activate commands that are supported by a standard keyboard interface.</p>
<p>
- The number and severity of disabilities tend to increase as people with age, and may include changes in vision, hearing, memory, or motor function, which can be accommodated on the Web as with any other disabilities.</p>
<p>
- Many of the accessibility solutions described in this Note contribute to "universal design" or "design for all" by benefiting non-disabled users. For example, support for speech output not only benefits blind users, but also Web users whose eyes are busy with other tasks; while captions of audio not only benefit deaf users but also increase the efficiency of indexing and searching audio content on Web sites.</p>
<p>
- Solutions for the barriers to Web site accessibility described in this section are available in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. Solutions for browser accessibility are available in the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, and for authoring tool accessibility in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines.</p>

<h2>
1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
<p>
   •	.AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved </p>
   <p>
   •	Standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to download the entire file before you can watch any of it. Use » Windows Media Player or pick up WinAmp or QuickTime.</p>
   <p>
   •	.CSS — Cascading StyleSheet</p>
   <p>
      <p>
   •	CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look. To read more about them, see our CSS tutorials. CSS files can be created or edited in any text-editor, like Notepad. Try » TopStyle Lite too, it includes loads of selectors for easy editing.</p>
   <p>
   •	.DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument
   
   •	Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them. Buy the hideously expensive » Microsoft Word, or just hope that it came with your computer. You can get a “Word viewer” from Microsoft too, which is free. If both of these go against your religion, you could use the free » Open Office suite, which is pretty damn good.</p>
   <p>
	•	.EXE — EXEcutable file
   •	If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file. Just double click it to install on your PC. Be careful of viruses!</p>
   <p>
	•	.GIF — Graphics Interchange Format
   •	The most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images. Read our Image File Formats page for more. Your browser can display them, or any image editor.</p>
   <p>
	•	.HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file
   •	Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files — What is HTML? You’re reading one right now. Sorted.</p>
   <p>
	•	.JPG/ .JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file
   •	Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos. Again, for more check out the Image File Formats page. Your browser can show them, or an image editor.</p>
   <p>
	•	.MIDI/ .MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface
   •	Midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. They’re usually really small and often sound great, although it largely depends on your sound-card. Midi collections are one of the few places in the world where you can find classic game and movie music, and for that I salute them. I use » WinAmp.</p>
   <p>
	•	.MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file
   •	Singlehandedly caused a revolution. MP3 is a sound file format which is highly compressed, which allows download-happy file-sizes and excellent quality. Has caused much grief for the music industry as songs are now small enough to be traded online. Get the superb » WinAmp for the best player around.</p>
   <p>
	•	.MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group file
   •	One of the standards for streaming movies. » WinAmp can play movies. Or you could use » Windows Media Player, by Microsoft.</p>
   <p>
	•	.MOV/ .QT — QuickTime MOVie
   •	The QuickTime format was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made the transition to the PC and is hugely popular. Get the » QuickTime Player for all your moving picture needs.</p>
   <p>
	•	.PDF — Portable Document Format
   •	Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the exact same, something which can’t be said about HTML files... Get the » Acrobat Reader to make sense of these things. It just reads them, mind. It costs if you want to make your own.</p>
   <p>
	•	.PNG — Portable Network Graphics
   •	PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support. Read more on our image formats page. Your browser can view them.</p>
   <p>
	•	.RAM — Real Audio Movie
   •	Real Networks created formats for streaming audio and video, and gave away free players for the formats, before allowing themselves to become so smothered in advertising that everyone with sense decided to stop using their programs. You might still come across real audio files around the net, so hand over all your personal details to get whatever player » Real are trying to sell you this week.</p>
   <p>
	•	.RAR — RAR archive
   •	This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. It sports advanced functions like special multimedia compression and has many benefits over zip files. Get the excellent » WinRAR to take care of your RAR archives, and it can handle other archive types too.</p>
   <p>
	•	.TIFF — Tagged Image File Format
   •	For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed through a browser. Your only choice is to get a — Hooray! — image editor.</p>
   <p>
	•	.TXT — TeXT file
   •	The most basic of files, it’s just some text. You no doubt already have either NotePad, SimpleText, or your browser, which you umm... definitely have.</p>
   <p>
	•	.WAV — WAVe sound file
   •	A basic, either un- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples. Your computer will be able to play these anyway (when it turns on and sings it’s playing a .wav). Get » WinAmp for more power.</p>
   <p>
	•	.ZIP — ZIPped file
   •	Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections, so be sure to have something to open them with. » WinZip is the best shareware program for unzipping files and making your own zips.</p>
